# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a Django Rest Framework (DRF) project designed to manage book borrowing, reservations, and reviews.

The project also uses Docker for containerization.

  - **Borrowers**: Borrow books, reserve books, view their borrowing history, and leave reviews.
- **Book Management**: Search and filter books, view book details.
- **Borrowing Transactions**: Automatically manage borrowing periods and due dates.
- **Reservations**: Reserve books that are currently borrowed.
